When I design products, I have one simple north star: Would my grandma understand this?

Not just any grandma—the coolest one. The one who wants to try new things but doesn't have time for unnecessarily complex interfaces. The one who appreciates elegance but needs clarity first.

### The Grandma Test

My grandma taught me that good design isn't about showing off technical prowess. It's about creating experiences that feel magical while remaining intuitive. When I build anything, I ask myself:

1. **Is it immediately clear what to do?** If someone needs a tutorial, I've already failed.
2. **Does it feel delightful?** Simplicity doesn't mean boring.
3. **Would I feel comfortable walking away while she uses it?** If not, it's not done yet.

### Elegant Simplicity

There's a profound difference between "dumbing down" and "clarifying." I never want to strip away sophistication—I want to make sophistication accessible.

Think of it like a high-end restaurant. The kitchen might use molecular gastronomy and complex techniques, but the menu doesn't explain the chemical reactions. It simply says "Lemon Tart" and delivers an unforgettable experience.

That's what I aim for: technical complexity hidden beneath an interface so clear that anyone—from my tech-savvy colleagues to my wonderful grandma—can have the same delightful experience.

### Why It Matters

In a world obsessed with features and cutting-edge tech, we often forget that technology exists to serve people—not the other way around.

My grandma reminded me that good technology should feel like magic, not like homework. If I can build something that makes her smile without making her frown first, I've created something truly valuable.

Ultimately, "Building for Coolest Grandma" isn't about age at all. It's about respecting everyone's time and cognitive load. It's about remembering that behind every user session is a human being who wants to accomplish something without having to think about your architecture decisions.

And if my actual grandma can use what I build while saying "that's neat!"—well, that's the best validation I could ask for.
